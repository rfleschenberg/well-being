# Well-being and talk resources

We found the resources listed below while working on our 
[Healthy Minds in a Healthy Community](https://2016.djangocon.eu/speakers/13)
presentation for DjangoCon Europe 2016. Not all of these resources were
used in the talk, but they did all inspire us. We're publishing them here
as they are likely to be useful to others too.

If you have ideas for other well-being resources that might fit, please
[create a new issue](https://github.com/erikr/well-being/issues/new).

_Not all of the descriptions below may be entirely accurate._

## Immediate care

- [Everything is awful and I'm not OK: questions to ask before giving up](http://i.imgur.com/pTsqcrw.jpg)

## Small but significant ways to change your thinking

- Meditation/mindfullness app Headspace includes some great videos on
  [expectation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xAeJKgupPI) and
  [blue skies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmqI1u72QLU). The ideas 
  in those are so remarkably simple, but especially the first one can be
  very helpful if your mind has a tendency to race with thoughts, and
  that frustrates you sometimes. 
- [Stop Saying “Sorry” And Say “Thank You” Instead](http://www.boredpanda.com/stop-saying-sorry-say-thank-you-comic-yao-xiao/).
  This tiny change makes a remarkable difference for both parties. I send this to anyone that apologises to me often.
- [A positivity trello board](http://anna-oz.tumblr.com/post/137764840235/a-positivity-trello-board)
  as a reminder of you being enough and doing enough.

## Self-esteem, self-identity, imposter syndrome and our perception of how others value us

- [The web is okay](http://www.charlotteis.co.uk/the-web-is-okay/) on 
  how modern web development can be overwhelming. "I'd like it if you,
  even if you don't believe it yet, try to tell yourself that you are a
  capable person. I’m trying too, and it’s super hard."
- [You're more successful than you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPt5XnCUOvg):
  people rate their own success and their loved ones do so too. I think
  this shows the really common issue of low self-esteem and imposter
  syndrome. The video is a bit cheesy.
- [An experiment in gratitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHv6vTKD6lg):
  people are instructed to write a letter for the person that made the
  biggest difference in their lives. Then they're told to call that 
  person and read out the letter.
  (I really don't like the guy in the lab coat though.)
- [Brett Cannon's post](http://www.snarky.ca/how-i-stay-happy-making-open-source-software)
  on how he stays happy in open source
- [Just make it already](http://closetcasefiles.com/just-make-it-already-how-to-boost-your-sewing-confidance/).
  It's about sewing, but applies just as much to development and imposter syndrome.
- [The Power of Vulnerability](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability)
- [The Power of Secrets](https://sarahwithee.com/talks/the-power-of-secrets/)

- [This is why I'll never be an adult](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.cz/2010/06/this-is-why-ill-never-be-adult.html) (reminiscent of the over/under-achievement that ADHD folks can go thru)
- [What do we want? A cure for ADHD!](http://img.memecdn.com/adhd_o_987673.jpg) (hints that it's hard to treat ADHD when you keep squirreling)

- [Why anxiety and depression are so difficult to fight](http://www.boredpanda.com/anxiety-depression-comics-nick-seluk-sarah-flanigan-awkward-yeti/)

## Creating welcoming communities

  obvious to most people, but especially people with mental health issues
  may find challenging or scary. Not only for them though. Not too active, but I really love this idea.

  help someone with an acute panic attack.
