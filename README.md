# erikr/well-being

This repository hosts the slides, resources and other
things related to
[Erik Romijn](https://twitter.com/erikpub) and 
[Mikey Ariel](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady)'s presentation
at DjangoCon Europe 2016:
[Healthy Minds in a Healthy Community](https://2016.djangocon.eu/speakers/13),
and the later versions for DjangoCon US 2016, try!Swift NYC 2016, Write the Docs Europe 2016
and Devfest NL 2016.

We also [published all resources we used](https://github.com/erikr/well-being/blob/master/resources.md)
in building this talk, that you might find helpful too.

We hope that this repository grow into a wider collection of resources
around well-being, so feel free to
[create an issue](https://github.com/erikr/well-being/issues) if you
see something that might fit in here.

If you organise or attend events, you may also be interested in Erik's
[Less Obvious Conference Checklist](https://github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist/).
