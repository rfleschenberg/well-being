# erikr/well-being

This repository initially hosts the slides, resources and other
things related to
[Erik Romijn](https://twitter.com/erikpub) and 
[Mikey Ariel](https://twitter.com/thatdocslady)'s presentation
at DjangoCon Europe 2016:
[Healthy Minds in a Healthy Community](https://2016.djangocon.eu/speakers/13).

We also [published all resources we used](https://github.com/erikr/well-being/blob/master/resources.md)
in building this talk, that you might find helpful too.
